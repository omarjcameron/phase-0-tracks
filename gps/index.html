What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags make it easier for your web page to communicate. Using semantic tags helps readers understand what's going on your page, and helps browers know how to display your markup. There a number of useful ones, but paragraph and blockquote are two that come to mind. 
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? The browser displays elements in the order they appear in the HTML. 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned that the snippets are a built in 'expander'. This helps you save time by implementing code or elements that you'll know you use often (or at least again). I can defintely seem myself using them. 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? The article element was most challenging. I think I can improve on this by reading up on it!
