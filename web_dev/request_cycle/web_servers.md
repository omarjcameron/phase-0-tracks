# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is essentially a computer that can run an operating system (and the subsquent software) directly from a hosting server/sevice.

# Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

For security reasons. When you run an application as root, you have the ability to control the whole server. If that were to be compromised, a would-be attacke can control your whole server.
