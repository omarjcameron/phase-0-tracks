# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control enables programmers to reconcile changes to files made by multiple users over different periods of time. It essentially provides a readily, digestible timeline for code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a deviation from the master code line that enables you to separately work on new features/changes and then if desired, commit them back to the original code line.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is adding new code/changes to git. It automatically creates a save point. Commit early and often! - When in doubt, you should Commit! One that is detailed and describes that action that has taken place.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflicts may occur if changes are made to the same file that are competing or if there are multiple files attempted to merge into one.
